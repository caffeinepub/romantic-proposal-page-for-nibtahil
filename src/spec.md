# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a romantic proposal web page that asks "Nibtahil, will you be mine?" with interactive Yes/No buttons, where the No button moves away on hover.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a romantic-themed landing page with pink and white color scheme
- Display the question "Nibtahil, will you be mine?" prominently
- Add Yes and No buttons where the No button moves to random positions on hover
- Show the uploaded romantic emoji image when Yes is clicked
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness for iPad and phone Chrome browsers

**User-visible outcome:** A romantic proposal page where Nibtahil can only click Yes (as No moves away), and upon clicking Yes, she sees a celebratory romantic emoji image.
